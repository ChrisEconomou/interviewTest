# interviewTest

Test spec:  See the included screenshots of a profile page. What the developer needs to do is   implement the same thing using: 1. The screen must be designed using Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines.  
2. The GridView/Listview implementation must use a RecyclerView   
3. The header is the same for both lists which are swipeable from left to right, the   header scrolls up with the list as seen in the screenshots  
4. The included json files are to be parsed for data, the header data is contained in   the header.json and  the products.json file may be used for both likes and selling   products.   
5. External libraries may be used, however we will take into consideration the   issues existing on the external library and determine if the library would fit the   purpose for a commercial app  
6. Items need not be clickable, however if time permits  clickable states on the UI   states as per Material guidelines would be a nice to have.  
7. Tests around the parsing and business logic is a nice to have  
8. We will take into consideration usage of styles and theme components so as to   make the styling modular  
9. We will also take into consideration the architecture of the app concerning   separation of UI layer from the data model.  10. Suggestions on improvements to your implementation as well as the UI will be   taken onboard  
11. Colours are not important, we can however provide the basic colour spec of the   app if required.
